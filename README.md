# A path to you career

# Description

A path to your Career, a solo project, represents the culmination of the skills I've acquired during the last module of my GA Software Engineering Bootcamp. It is a full-stack application that is designed to help users explore different career opportunities through job listings, courses, and bootcamps while keeping track of everything they applied to. The backend was developed using Django and PostgreSQL, while the frontend was built with React, JavaScript and Tailwind CSS.
